I am currently an Honours student at the Australian National University, supervised by [Dr. Thang Bui](https://thangbui.github.io/). My Honours project is looking at how to interpret transformer residual streams as computational primitives expressible as executable code.

In general, I like playing around with the internals of pre-trained transformers and figuring out what's going on. I also think this is one of the best ways to form new ideas about how to improve them.

I also run a startup called [Rake News](https://rake.news/) along with Max Kirkby, where we are building a peer-to-peer personalised news platform that uses large language models for debiasing, aggregation and synthesis of news stories tailored to each individual reader.
